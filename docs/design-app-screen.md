# design_app_screen_v1: app screens, stage by stage

Design's product-design flow for app screens (UI/UX), the one Design ran by hand for RollCall and
Inkflow, as a Temper workflow. The owner asked for it on 2026-11-04: "lets try to encode the different
stages you had of your flow into temper wf".

This is version 1's skeleton (Design #198, W0): every stage, both owner gates, the workspace, a
contract for each step's output and the first known case. The stages are stubs. In fixture mode each
copies the known case's output and has it checked against its contract. In real mode a stub stage
fails at once with "the real stage is not built yet". Each stage's own task (W1-W5) replaces its stub
and keeps its contract.

Files, one job each:

| File | Job |
| --- | --- |
| `configs/design/workflows/design_app_screen_v1.yaml` | the workflow: 8 stages, 2 owner gates, 2 loops back to build |
| `configs/design/agents/design_app_screen_stage_v1.yaml` | script agent: runs one step through the CLI (no model, no network) |
| `configs/design/bin/design_app_screen.py` | CLI: one step on a workspace, or the host commands pack, freeze, verify |
| `configs/design/bin/app_screen/workspace.py` | the workspace: stage folders, `run.json`, rounds |
| `configs/design/bin/app_screen/contracts.py` | one JSON schema per output file, plus `validate(step, workspace)` |
| `configs/design/bin/app_screen/gates.py` | the two owner gates: check and record the answer |
| `configs/design/bin/app_screen/known_case.py` | known cases: freeze, verify, pack, copy a stage's output |
| `configs/design/bin/app_screen/fixture_stage.py` | what a stub stage does: fixture copy, or fail loud in real mode |
| `configs/design/bin/app_screen/<stage>.py` | one module per stage: `intake`, `existing`, `ground`, `directions`, `build`, `checks`, `show`, `handoff` |
| `tests/test_design_app_screen_contracts.py` | contracts, gates, freeze and the CLI, on the known case |
| `tests/design_app_screen_case/rollcall-20261104/` | the known case's JSON and Markdown outputs (the pictures and pages stay in the lab) |

## Stages

| # | Stage | Steps (workflow nodes) | Leaves | Built by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | intake | `intake` | the owner's request as requirements (his words verbatim) and the open questions (rule 33) | W1 |
| 2 | existing | `existing` | today's screens captured and measured; the user journeys, each problem with evidence | W2 |
| 3 | ground | `ground` | one shared fixture, the product's design files, the screens x states inventory | W2 |
| 4 | directions | `directions`, then `gate_direction` | two or more clickable directions, each with its quick checks; the owner picks one | W3, W5 |
| 5 | build | `build` | the chosen direction: a shell and one file per screen | W3 |
| 6 | checks | `checks`, then `review` | measured checks by script, then findings rated 0-4 and Must/Should/Could/Won't; a Must loops back to build | W4 |
| 7 | show | `show`, then `gate_final`, `gate_final_next` | one Show&Tell share and the owner's comments; approve, or changes back to build as targeted edits | W4, W5 |
| 8 | handoff | `handoff` | a spec per screen, the design file, the follow-ups for other roles | W4 |

Loops: `review` goes back to `build` while its verdict is `revise` (a Must finding is open), and
`gate_final_next` goes back to `build` when the final answer is `changes`. Each loop runs at most twice
(`max_loops: 2`); a third time fails the run (`on_max_loops: fail`), it does not hand off a design that
still has an open Must. Each pass through `checks` starts a new `06-checks/round-<n>/`.

Inputs: `product` (a lowercase id, e.g. `rollcall`), `mode` (`real`, the default, or `fixture`) and
`request_json` (the request text for intake; unused in fixture mode). Outputs: the direction picked and
who decided it, the review rounds and verdict, and the final verdict and who decided it.

## Workspace

Every step reads and writes only inside the run's workspace:

```
run.json                    product, mode real|fixture, round, status of every step
known-case/                 fixture mode only: the known case, packed by the host, with FREEZE.json
01-request/                 requirements.json, questions.json
02-existing/                captures/*.png, audit.json (measured), journeys.json (model; each claim has evidence)
03-ground/                  fixture.json, design-files/ (DESIGN.md, tokens.json), inventory.json (screens x states)
04-directions/<id>/         index.html, checks.json; plus directions.json and gate_direction.json
05-build/                   shell/, screens/, index.html, build.json
06-checks/round-<n>/        checks.json, review.json
07-show/                    showtell.json, comments.json, gate_final.json
08-handoff/                 spec/*.md, design-file.json, followup.json
```

`run.json` records each step as `running`, `done` or `failed` with a time; a failed step keeps its reason.

## Contracts

`contracts.validate(step, workspace)` checks every file the step must leave: that it exists (at least
the stated number for a pattern), that JSON files parse and match their schema, that PNG and HTML files
are PNG and HTML, and the rules a schema can't say (a capture, direction page or screen file named in a
JSON file exists; the direction gate picks a direction that exists; a review with an open Must finding
says `revise`). A broken output fails the step with every problem, each as `<file>: <field>: <reason>`,
for example:

```
review: 1 problem(s): 06-checks/round-1/review.json: verdict: is 'done' but must be 'revise' (a Must finding is open)
```

The fields, by file (the full schemas are in `contracts.py`). A file holds only its schema's fields, so
a new field is a contract change; only `fixture.json`, `tokens.json` and an audit screen's `measures` are
open objects:

| File | Must hold |
| --- | --- |
| `requirements.json` | `product`; `items[]`: `id` (R1...), `owner_words` (verbatim), `source`, `kind` (goal, feature, change, constraint, taste), `maps_to[]` |
| `questions.json` | `questions[]`: `id`, `question`, `status` (open, answered); an answered one also `answer` and `answer_source` |
| `audit.json` | `source`; `screens[]`: `id`, `width`, `state`, `capture` (a PNG in 02-existing/), `measures` |
| `journeys.json` | `journeys[]`: `id` (J1...), `name`, `goal`, `problems[]` of `claim` + `evidence[]` |
| `fixture.json` | any JSON object: the product's shared sample data |
| `inventory.json` | `design_files` (defined, partial, none); `screens[]`: `id`, `name`, `states[]`, `widths[]`, optional `spec` |
| `directions.json` | `directions[]`: `id`, `name`, `idea`, `page` (an HTML file in 04-directions/); at least two |
| `<id>/checks.json`, `round-<n>/checks.json` | `checks[]`: `id`, `value`, `result` (pass, fail), `evidence`, `element`, `location` |
| `review.json` | `round`, `verdict` (done, revise); `findings[]`: `id`, `element`, `location`, `evidence`, `severity` 0-4, `priority` (must, should, could, wont) |
| `build.json` | `direction`, `round`, `page`, `widths[]`, `screens[]`: `id`, `file` (in 05-build/), optional `states[]` |
| `showtell.json` | `doc_id`, `version`, `url` |
| `comments.json` | `doc_id`; `comments[]`: `number`, `version`, `body`, `element`, `state`, optional `replies[]` |
| `gate_<name>.json` | see Gates; no fields beyond these |
| `design-file.json` | `kind` (penpot, html-prototype), `location`, `editable` (true or false) |
| `followup.json` | `items[]`: `id`, `what`, `owner_role`, `source` |

Change a contract only together with the stage that writes the file, and keep the known case passing.

## Gates

Two owner gates for now, direction and final (owner, 2026-11-04: "to gather information and maybe
taste"; to be encoded later so the workflow can run fully on its own). Each is a Temper gate node; the
answer is its gate response, JSON text:

```
{"choice": "a", "decided_by": "owner", "owner_words": "I like the direction of A better",
 "source": "owner in Design lead dialog 2026-11-05T00:38Z", "reason": "..."}
```

`choice` is a direction id at the direction gate, and `approve` or `changes` at the final gate (`changes`
also gives `comments`, the Show&Tell comment numbers the next build answers). `decided_by` is `owner` or
`design`; `owner_words` is required for the owner, verbatim, and refused for design. Nobody's answer is
invented: a missing, non-JSON or incomplete answer fails the gate. The step writes `gate_<name>.json` with
the answer plus `prediction` (the judges' guess of his answer, filled in by W5; `null` for now) and
`taste` (W5 appends a real answer to `~/design-lab/taste/owner.md`; `pending-w5` until then, `not-taste`
in a fixture run). Answer a gate with `POST /api/runs/<run>/approve/<node>` and body `{"response": "<the
JSON text>"}`, signed (`~/design-lab/tools/temper_call.py`).

## Known cases and fixture runs

A known case is a finished job frozen as each stage's real output, so each stage can be tested alone on
fixed inputs with known answers (AGENTS.md rule 16). It lives in
`~/design-lab/app-screen-workflow/known-cases/<name>/`, laid out like a workspace, plus `gates/` (the gate
answers really given) and `FREEZE.json` (`case`, `product`, `frozen_at`, `source`, and a sha256 per file).
A changed, missing or extra file fails `verify`, `pack` and every fixture step; a frozen case is never
re-frozen.

Known case 1, `rollcall-20261104`: the RollCall phone and desktop redesign of 2026-11-04 (Design
#170-#196). Its request is the owner's ask and his Show&Tell comments on option A with his dialog answers;
existing is the #170 audit (56 captures, measures, 6 journeys from the 12 findings); ground is the
shared fixture, direction A's design files and 17 screens x 5 states x 3 widths; directions are the quick
drafts A and B with the owner's pick (A); build is draft A after his comments and the gap screens;
checks are draft A's 15 check scripts re-run on a snapshot, with one Should finding from the one that
failed; show is his comments on Show&Tell `d_kgrxir5ezb`; handoff is the 13 screen specs and the
follow-ups RollCall and Frontend sent. RollCall's numbers are its invented sample book; no client or
private data. It was built by `build_rollcall_20261104.py` next to it.

A fixture run (the worker can't see Design's lab, so the host packs the case into the workspace first;
the workspace must be under `~/temper-ai/workspaces`, which runs mount):

```
python3 configs/design/bin/design_app_screen.py pack \
  --case ~/design-lab/app-screen-workflow/known-cases/rollcall-20261104 \
  --workspace ~/temper-ai/workspaces/<run folder>
python3 ~/design-lab/tools/temper_call.py POST /api/runs '{"workflow": "design_app_screen_v1",
  "workspace_path": "<run folder>", "inputs": {"product": "rollcall", "mode": "fixture"}}'
```

then answer both gates with `decided_by` `design` (a fixture answer is never the owner's). Every step
reports `valid: true`; the direction gate also reports `known_case_choice`, the owner's real pick, to
compare with. Costs $0: no model runs.

To add a known case: lay out a finished job's real outputs as a workspace under
`known-cases/<product>-<date>/`, with `06-checks/round-1/` and `gates/gate_direction.json`,
`gates/gate_final.json` (the answers really given, the owner's words verbatim with their source). Keep it
free of client or private data. Check each stage with `design_app_screen.py <step>` on a packed workspace,
then freeze it once:

```
python3 configs/design/bin/design_app_screen.py freeze --case <dir> --product <id> --source "<what it is>"
python3 configs/design/bin/design_app_screen.py verify --case <dir>
```

Write a builder script next to it, as `build_rollcall_20261104.py` is, so how it was made stays readable.

## Stage status

| Stage | Real stage | Task |
| --- | --- | --- |
| all eight, both gates | stub: fixture mode only | W1-W5 |

## Tests

`python3 -m pytest -q tests/test_design_app_screen_contracts.py`: the known case passes every contract
and a whole fixture run; a broken copy of each file fails for its named reason; the gates refuse invented
or incomplete answers; a changed or extra known-case file fails the freeze check; the CLI refuses an
unknown step and a missing workspace; a real-mode stub fails loud. On spark it also verifies the frozen
case in the lab and that the repo copy matches it.
